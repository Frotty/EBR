Escape Builder Reloaded

This is the Wurst Code Repository of the wc3 map Escape Builder.

Everything is open-source, though I would like it if you didn't just steal my work but either 
suggest changes and additions or ask for permission.

As is - this source is for educationaly purposes - for example if you want to know how I did spedific things.
